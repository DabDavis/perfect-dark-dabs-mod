# Perfect Dark port — simulant/mod fork

Fork of the [fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark](https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark) port.
`port` tracks upstream; work happens on `mod/dabs-mod`.

`git checkout port` returns to stock at any time.

## Build and run

```sh
cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -Bbuild .     # only after adding/removing source files
cmake --build build -j8
./build/pd.x86_64                      # needs build/data/pd.ntsc-final.z64
./build/pd-modded.sh                   # with the All in One mod
```

Release builds use `-Og`, not `-O2` — see the comment in `CMakeLists.txt`. Warnings
about uninitialised locals in `collision.c`, `model.c`, `menu.c` and `mplayer/setup.c`
are pre-existing decomp artifacts; check `git diff` before assuming one is yours.

`build/` is gitignored, including the mod directories and `pd-modded.sh`. Keep the
mod zip: a clean rebuild takes them with it.

## This is a decompilation

Much of `src/` is decompiled N64 code. Two consequences that matter:

**Structs with offset comments** (`/*0x1be7*/`) document the original ROM layout.
Growing them breaks matching builds. Ours sets `MATCHING=0`, but treat it as a real
cost when considering upstreaming.

**Some code is unreachable by construction on N64** and becomes reachable the moment
a limit is raised. Every bug in this fork's history was of that shape: a fixed-size
table or an assumption nobody wrote down. `chrInit()` dereferenced NULL when the chr
pool was exhausted; `mpCreateBotFromProfile()` looped forever once chrs outnumbered
the 53 available heads; `langGetLangBankIndexFromStagenum()` had `default: while(true){}`.
When raising any cap, grep for fixed-size arrays indexed by the thing you are scaling.

## A chr's prop and model are read before its tick, not during

`chrTick()` (`src/game/chr.c`) reads `prop` and `model` once, then calls into the
action handler and keeps using those locals afterwards — `chrRemove(prop, true)` at
the end is on the prop it read at the top. So anything that moves a body between chrs
has to happen outside the prop tick. `modBodiesTick()` runs from `chraTickBg()`, which
is the first thing `propsTick()` does and the one point in the frame where no prop is
part way through its own tick; the dead simulant is left waiting a tick rather than
respawned from inside `chrTickDead()`.

## Memory: what an MP chr costs, and which pool it comes from

`body0f02ce8c()` (`src/game/body.c`) takes a different path in multiplayer: with no
`headmodeldef` passed in it calls `modeldefLoadToNew()` **every time**, a fresh ~50KB
copy of the head from `MEMPOOL_STAGE` that is never freed, because each simulant's
head is offset to fit its own body. Stock pays that once per bot at match start.
Anything that creates chr models *during* a match must pass the modeldefs in, or it
empties the stage pool in about a minute.

`mempAlloc()` fills the onboard bank first and falls through to the expansion bank,
which is a hardcoded 8MB (`MEMP_EXPANSION_POOL_SIZE`) no matter what `Game.MemorySize`
says — that setting grows the onboard side only. So `mempGetStageFree()`, which
answers for one bank, is not "how much room is left"; `mempGetStageFreeTotal()` is.
A pool-full warning naming one pool is the onboard bank spilling over, not the end.

`mempAlloc()` returns NULL when both are out, and most callers do not check.
`modelmgrInstantiateModel()` now does.

## ROM-resident structures — never grow these

`preprocessMpConfigs()` (`port/src/preprocess/misc.c`) casts raw ROM bytes to
`struct mpconfig` and strides by `sizeof`. `struct mpconfig` and `struct mpstrings`
are therefore layout-locked; `_Static_assert`s in `mplayer.c` enforce it.

That is why `MAX_BOTS_CONFIG` (8, ROM-resident) is separate from `MAX_BOTS` (80,
runtime). Anything reading `config->simulants[]` or `strings.aibotnames[]` must
bound by `MAX_BOTS_CONFIG`.

`mpsetup.chrslots` is a `u16` inside that struct, so simulant participation lives in
a separate runtime array (`g_MpSimSlots`), mirrored back into `chrslots` for the low
8 slots. It was a `u64` bitmask until 80 exceeded 64 — prefer per-slot flags over
bitmasks here.

## Save format

`mpsetupfileSaveWad()`/`LoadWad()` take a version. The port's file has a version byte
and per-version block sizes (`MPSETUP_BLOCKSIZE_V1` vs `MPSETUP_BLOCKSIZE`). Files
stay in the base format unless a setup actually needs >8 simulants, so unmodified
builds can still read them; changing version re-encodes every block.

`savebufferOr()` does no bounds checking. `stagenum` is stored in 7 bits.

## Text rendering

`textMeasure()` adds a line of height only when it sees `\n`. A string without a
trailing newline measures as zero height and renders clipped. ROM strings have it;
anything synthesised needs it too.

## Stage numbers

Adding stages at runtime is constrained from several directions at once:

- `stagenum < STAGE_TITLE` (0x5a) is the engine's "is this a real level" test, in
  16 places. At or above it, `setupLoadFiles()` silently does nothing.
- `STAGE_TITLE`, `STAGE_BOOTPAKMENU`, `STAGE_CREDITS`, `STAGE_4MBMENU` are used
  outside `g_Stages`, so scanning the table alone will not show them as taken.
- `langGetLangBankIndexFromStagenum()` must know the stage (now falls back safely).
- `g_StageAllocations8Mb` has no entry for runtime stages, so they get a default
  allocation. Too small means `MEMPOOL_STAGE` exhaustion surfacing far from the cause.

Only 27 ids are free below `STAGE_TITLE`.

## The frame is presented before videoEndFrame()

`gfx_run()` ends with `swap_buffers_begin()`, which is the `SDL_GL_SwapWindow()`
call, so by the time `videoEndFrame()` runs the back buffer is already gone and
reading it back gives garbage. Anything that needs the finished image hooks
`videoSetPreSwapCallback()`, which fires inside `gfx_run()` with the frame drawn
and not yet swapped. That is where the screenshot key reads its pixels.

`gfx_current_window_dimensions` is `SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize()`, and under Xvfb
with no window manager a fullscreen-desktop window reports the screen size while
the X window stays 640x480. Reading a rect larger than the real drawable leaves
those pixels undefined, which looks like heap garbage in the corner of the
image - set `DefaultFullscreen=0` in pd.ini before trusting a headless capture.

## Mod directories

Only the **first** mod dir joins the general file search. Later ones are reached
solely through file slots pinned to them (`romfile.moddir`). Mod suites ship full
asset sets under stock names — the All in One suite shares 245 filenames across five
directories — so overlaying them all replaces stock textures everywhere.

Files are cached per file id, so two mods shipping the same filename need separate
slots. `--modstages` enables runtime stage registration; it is incomplete.

## Debugging

Guessing from source failed repeatedly here; the stack was right every time.

```sh
# crash: symbolise the offsets the game prints
addr2line -f -C -e build/pd.x86_64 0x11abf5

# hang: main thread only, Mesa worker threads are noise
gdb -p $(pgrep -x pd.x86_64) -batch -ex "thread 1" -ex "bt 14"
```

stdout is block-buffered when redirected, so log lines sit unwritten. Flush a live
process before reading or killing it — `SIGKILL` discards the buffer:

```sh
gdb -p $(pgrep -x pd.x86_64) -batch -ex 'call (int)fflush(0)'
```

A hung process ignores `SIGTERM`, because the shutdown handler cannot run.

For "state disappears" bugs, instrument every mutating path rather than reading code.
The simulant-clearing hunt was solved by logging that showed a count of zero at every
suspected site — nothing was being cleared; nothing had ever been created.
